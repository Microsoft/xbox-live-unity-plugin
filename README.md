## Welcome!

The Xbox Live Unity Plugin provides a way for developers to quickly and easily integrate Xbox Live functionality into their [Unity](https://unity3d.com/) based game. 
To get access to the Xbox Live service, please apply to the [ID@Xbox program](http://www.xbox.com/en-us/Developers/id).

## Getting Started
The Unity Plugin is broken into the following parts

* __Assets__ contains the Unity project content.
  * The actual Xbox Live plugin assets in the plugin package are located in the __Xbox Live__ folder inside.
* __Build__ contains scripts to generate the .unitypackage.
